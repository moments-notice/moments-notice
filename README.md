an experiment in correspondence

Moment’s Notice Project is an experiment in correspondence. If you would like to participate, please [sign up](http://moments-notice.org), and when the moment is right, I’ll send you a roll of 35mm film. You’re on your own to shoot the roll. It can be anything you like. It can span a year, or a week or a day. When you’re done with the roll, mail it back, unprocessed. I will process your film, archive and scan your negatives, edit your shoot and include a few frames in a monthly newsletter along with the other submissions.
