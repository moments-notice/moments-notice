<h1>Welcome to Moment's Notice</h1>

<p>Moment’s Notice Project is an experiment in correspondence. If you would like to participate, please sign up, and when the moment is right, I’ll send you a roll of 35mm film. You’re on your own to shoot the roll. It can be anything you like. It can span a year, or a week or a day. When you’re done with the roll, mail it back, unprocessed. I will process your film, archive and scan your negatives, edit your shoot and include a few frames in a monthly newsletter along with the other submissions.</p>

<p><strong>What happens next?</strong></p>
<p>I keep your film, forever. I’ll keep it really nice, and safe. You own the copyright, and I retain license to do some typical non-threatening stuff with your images ( detailed in our forthcoming Terms of Use part of all of this ). If you ever want to make prints from your negatives, just give me a shout and we will work it out. Eventually ALL  of the images from the rolls you submit will be made part of a public archive website. This website will allow you to update each shot with metadata and it will allow others to comment and share the photos, just like most websites do these days.</p>
<p><strong>Why this?</strong></p>
<p>This project is about correspondence&#8211;I said that already. It’s also about the dying art of analog photography. It’s about the avalanche of imagery posted to the internet every single second of our lives. It’s about slowing your brain down, and it&#8217;s about breathing. I&#8217;m curious about selection, and curation, and building a long lasting archive of images that communicate something cerebral&#8211;something that lives outside the current framework.</p>
<p><strong>Why should I?</strong></p>
<p>Think of this as an opportunity to be a part of something small. You&#8217;ll be connecting with me, the person running this project. I&#8217;ll be processing your film and scanning and editing your photos. I&#8217;ll be very intimately aware of your &#8220;minds eye.&#8221; Then, I&#8217;ll be selecting your photos and trying to make sense of them. I&#8217;ll be communicating this back to you and anyone else who is interested. It&#8217;s the start of a conversation.</p>
<p>Also, it&#8217;s all FREE! That&#8217;s right, you get at least one roll of film for free. I&#8217;m going to process and scan your film and add it to a nifty website archive which you will have access to&#8211;for free. I just ask that you pay the postage to send the roll back to me.</p>
<p>Most importantly, think of this as a chance to contribute to a growing, working archive. I hope that this collection of images and newsletters becomes a tool for future students of photography to use freely. As a photo student I used to really enjoy looking at my classmate&#8217;s contact sheets. The series of 36 thumbnails was such an insightful look into how other people were thinking about a similar problem. This project aims to present a similar point of view by presenting your rolls of film as &#8220;virtual contact sheets.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Why film?</strong></p>
<p>The physicality of photographic film allow us as a group to force ourselves into a situation where we need to mail things back and forth. It presents us with a challenge where we don&#8217;t have the aid of the instant feedback that a digital camera affords. Film limits us to 36 exposures per roll. It brings us back to a life before iPhones and geo-tagging, and a time where we had to take notes, and read light values and&#8230; I could go on for quite a while on this topic.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have a 35mm camera, you can get one really cheap these days. If you have a hundred bucks or so, I&#8217;d recommend searching eBay for an old Nikon FM2 or a Canon AE or something similar. If you don&#8217;t have a hundred bucks you can go even cheaper with something like a Lomo, or a simple used point and shoot 35mm camera on eBay.</p>
<p><strong>Ok, how do I play?</strong></p>
<p>To participate, all you have to do is enter your email address in the box below. You’ll get added to the mailing list and will begin to receive about one email a month featuring the newest images from the project.</p>
<p>Eventually, you will receive an invitation email. This email will contain a link that will take you to a form where you will fill out some shipping info and your details. Then after a short while you’ll receive your first roll of film. Once you’ve shot the roll, send it back to the address supplied. I’ll process the film by hand in my little home-made darkroom. I’ll use the best, most archival, artisanal chemical process I can work out. I’ll then make high-res scans of all of your images. These scans and smaller-res versions will be uploaded to a new archive website. Each frame and each roll will be given a unique ID and a persistent URL. Your negatives will be stored in my state of the art archival filing system, somewhere in Brooklyn, New York.</p>
<p>Each month I will produce an email newsletter featuring some of the best work submitted to the project. If you submitted a roll of film, I promise to include at least one of your photos in at least one of the monthly newsletters. Your photo will link back to your full archive on the website where anyone can share their thoughts, give you feedback and engage in conversations around your images.</p>
<p>You’ll also be provided with an account that will let you update and maintain your image archive. You wont be able to delete any of the images ( unless you really really need to and in that case you should just send me an email ) but you’ll be able to update all of the metadata associated with each image and each roll. This will really benefit everyone as it will help with search-ability. You will be able to add geo-location information, captions, titles, tags, and details about how you made the photograph, what kind of camera you used and what your mood was like when you made the shot.</p>
<p><strong>Now what?</strong></p>
<p>Sign up by entering your email address below and wait. I&#8217;ll be sending you updates about once a month, and you&#8217;ll eventually get an invitation to participate. If you want to just follow along you can simply ignore the invite, and continue receiving the newsletters.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait to see what we make together.</p>
